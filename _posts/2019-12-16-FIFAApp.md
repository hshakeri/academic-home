## Introduction
<br> 
For the final project, the team elected to have each member investigate and present a possible data set with which to work.  HuiLin presented a data set focused on recent IMDB films and television shows, Binyong presented a data set focused on schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Travis presented a data set focused on the 2019 results of San Francisco’s Bay to Breakers race, and Yihnew presented a data set focused on current FIFA player statistics.  After much discussion, the team down-selected to Yihnew’s set on October 21st given its breadth (over 16,000 unique players), width (20 columns of data per player), and general appeal (the ubiquitous international popularity of soccer).  The team soon realized that the potential to determine the “best” squads of soccer players across various criteria could not only assist enthusiasts of the video game FIFA 20 (from which the data set was derived) in creating well-composed virtual squads, but could be further extended into the real world to estimate the “best” 
squads by field configuration, then by categories like country, continent, professional league, and so forth.
<br> 
<br> 
In conceiving a program that would allow users the ability to choose such “best” squads across such diverse criteria, the question that naturally emerged was: could we have beaten the octopus?  As many may have remembered, in 2010 Paul the Octopus gained global acclaim due to the perceived accuracy of his prognostications concerning the results of World Cup matches.  While Paul the Octopus is sadly no longer with us, the spirit of predicting the outcomes of soccer matches is still very much relevant particularly in the sports-betting world.  Having a program that extracts, reads in, and processes current soccer player data could be considered a useful tool for attempting to do such a thing.
<br> 
<br>
It’s noted that to keep the scope of this project limited, the team is only considering active players in the FIFA 20 data set as given by all gold,, silver, and bronze players. For example, the first page of gold players are listed as: https://www.futbin.com/20/players?page=1&sort=Player_Rating&order=desc&version=gold.  It is also assumed that players can be classified as attacker, midfielder, defender, or goal keeper irrespective of specific positions thereof.  Finally, in predicting the “best” squads, the team assumed that all players belonging to a particular data subset would be available to form such a squad (that is, all squads formed are “ideal” based on current player statistics and rankings, and ignores player injuries, red card status, decisions to sit out, and so forth).
<br> 
<br> 
Beyond developing such a predictive tool, the team also hoped to be able to demonstrate the relationship between various player statistic categories and to be able to make direct, detailed comparisons between players across such categories.  The final intent was to make the tool interactive, intuitive, and visual for the user, which allowed the team an opportunity to gain more experience in using Python libraries like bokeh and seaborn.


## About the data
<br>BeautifulSoup was used to scrape the data from https://www.futbin.com/20/players?page=1&sort=Player_Rating&order=desc&version=gold, a site dedicated to enthusiasts of the FIFA video game series.  In particular, the team elected to focus on player data from the most recent entry in the series, FIFA 20, as this represents current, comprehensive stats for nearly 16,750 FIFA players.  This data includes categories like **name, club, country, league, overall rating, position, skill, weak foot, work rate, pace, shooting (rating), passing (rating), dribbling (rating), defending (rating), physicality (rating), height, base stats, and in-game stats**.   The team subsequently added a category of continent (determined based on the player’s country) and further sub-categorized the players as **attacker, midfielder, defender, and goal keeper** based on the position value.

## Results

We have used pie charts, box plots, bar plots to graphically display our findings. For example, we learned that some countries have abundant good soccer players, and some countries have limited amount of players. We learned that certain physical attributes are more important for certain type of players. A good example is that goalies are usually tall players. Very importantly, we implemented graphical user interaction, and users can extract their desired information easily by a few mouse clicks. By the way, one of user story was which country has the best team, i.e. in our attempt to beat Paul the Octopus. The best team, based on the "Overall rating", is Spain, and the second best team is France. Considering France won the world cup last year, and Spain won it in 2010, we might have a good chance against Paul! 



```python
# Read in csv file
fifa = pd.read_csv('FIFA Player Info.csv', keep_default_na = False)
fifa = fifa.drop(columns='Unnamed: 0')
```

In 2019, a total of 159 countries were represented in FIFA 20. The top three participating countries based on the numbers of players are England, Germany and Spain.


```python
numplayers = fifa['Country'].value_counts().sort_values(ascending = False).head(10)
n = plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
nx1 = n.add_subplot(111)

xvalue = numplayers.index
yvalue = numplayers.values
g = sns.barplot(xvalue, yvalue) 
plt.ylabel("Overall Rating")
plt.title('Top 10 Nations Participating in FIFA 20')
plt.xlabel('Countries')
plt.ylabel('Num of Players')

def barlabel(series):
    i = 0
    for index, row in series.items():
        g.text(i, row+1, round(row, 2), color='black', ha="center", fontsize = 13)
        i = i + 1
    return i
barlabel(numplayers)
```

Below is the distribution of top 10 participating country. Brazil has the highest mean overall rating, while Japan has the lowest mean overall rating. However, Germany has the largest distrubtion as you can see many outliers.


```python
# Top contries overall rating distribution
some_countries = ('England', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'France', 'Argentina', 'Italy', 'Colombia', 'Japan', 'Brazil', 'Holland')
df_countries = fifa.loc[fifa['Country'].isin(some_countries) & fifa['Overall Rating']].sort_values(by = 'Country', ascending = True)

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 7)
ax = sns.boxplot(x = df_countries['Country'], y = df_countries['Overall Rating'], palette = 'colorblind')
ax.set_xlabel(xlabel = 'Countries', fontsize = 13)
ax.set_ylabel(ylabel = 'Overall Rating', fontsize = 13)
ax.set_title(label = 'Distribution of Overall Rating of Players from Top 10 Countries', fontsize = 20)
```




    Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Distribution of Overall Rating of Players from Top 10 Countries')




![png](/images/output_10_1.png)


The bar graph below reveals the average overall rating of the top 10 countries. Brazil having the highest average overall rating does not necessarily mean the have the best players.


```python
by_country = fifa[fifa.Country.isin(some_countries)==True]
by_country = by_country.groupby('Country')['Overall Rating'].mean()
by_country.sort_values(ascending = True).head(10)
b = plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
bx1 = b.add_subplot(111)

xvalue = by_country.index
yvalue = by_country.values
g = sns.barplot(xvalue, yvalue) 
b = plt.ylabel("Overall Rating")
plt.title('Average Overall Rating of the Top 10 Nations Participating in FIFA 20')
barlabel(by_country)
```

**Comparsion of 2 Players**
<br>
User can enter or select 2 players to compare. The pie chart allows a side by side comparsion of each skill Rating between 2 players. The default players selected are the top 2 players, Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.


```python
data = fifa[['Name','Pace', 'Shooting','Passing', 'Dribbling', 'Defending', 'Physicality']]
HeatmapData = data.groupby('Name').mean()
labels = np.array(HeatmapData.columns.values)
N = len(labels)

angles2 = []
for i in range(N):
    ang = 90 + i*180/np.pi
    if ang > 360:
        ang = abs(360 - ang)
    angles2.append(ang)
angles2.sort()
angles = [ math.radians(i) for i in angles2]
```


```python
name = fifa.Name.tolist()[0]
name2 = fifa.Name.tolist()[1]
stats = HeatmapData.loc[name, labels]

fig1 = plt.figure(figsize=(12,10))
ax1 = fig1.add_subplot(111, polar=True)
ax1.plot(angles, stats, 'bo', linewidth=1,alpha=0.3)
ax1.fill(angles, stats, 'b', alpha=0.1)
stats2=HeatmapData.loc[name2,labels]
ax1.plot(angles, stats2, 'ro', linewidth=1,alpha=0.3)
ax1.fill(angles, stats2, 'r', alpha=0.1)
ax1.set_thetagrids(angles2, labels, fontsize=12)
ax1.set_title(name + " vs " + name2)
ax1.set_label('Label via method')
for i in range(N):
    ax1.text(angles[i], stats[i], str(int(stats[i])),color='blue', alpha=0.7,fontsize=12,verticalalignment='top', horizontalalignment='left',)
    ax1.text(angles[i], stats2[i], str(int(stats2[i])),color='red', alpha=0.7,fontsize=12,verticalalignment='bottom', horizontalalignment='right')
ax1.legend([name, name2], loc=1)
ax1.grid(True)
```

**Positions**
<br>
There are a total of 17 positions in FIFA 20. The most common positions are Center Back (CB), Striker (ST), and Central Midfielder (CM)


```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (12, 8))
count_positions = fifa.groupby('Position')['Overall Rating'].count().reset_index(name='Overall Rating').sort_values(['Overall Rating'], ascending=False)                

xvalue = count_positions['Position']
yvalue = count_positions['Overall Rating']

c = sns.barplot(xvalue, yvalue) 
p = plt.ylabel("Num of Players")

plt.title('Different Positions in Football')

def barlabelpandas(pandas):
    i = 0
    for index, row in pandas.iteritems():
        c.text(i, row+10, round(row, 2), color='black', ha="center", fontsize = 13)
        i = i + 1
    return i
barlabelpandas(count_positions['Overall Rating'])
```

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (12, 8))
count_positions_groups = fifa.groupby('Position Group')['Overall Rating'].count().reset_index(name='Overall Rating').sort_values(['Overall Rating'], ascending=False)                

xvalue = count_positions_groups['Position Group']
yvalue = count_positions_groups['Overall Rating']

c = sns.barplot(xvalue, yvalue) 
p = plt.ylabel("Num of Players")

plt.title('Different Position Groups in Football')

Below is the distribution of overall rating per positions for each continent. As the graph illustrates, South American has the highest rated players compared to other continents. While, Oceania and Asia have the lowest overall rating.


```python
ax = sns.boxplot(x="Position Group", y="Overall Rating", hue="Continent", data=fifa, palette="Set2")
```

Below are the top 5 national teams in the world. The best teams were determined by calculating the highest overall rating for a country regardless of the formation. As you can see Spain has the best team using the formation 4-5-1, while France, the second best team, using a 4-3-3 formation.


```python

        for i in range(0, len(countries)):
            players = bestformation(fifa[fifa['Country'] == countries[i]], 'Any', 'Overall Rating')
            team_rating = players['Overall Rating'].mean()
            if team_rating > best_value:
                best_value = team_rating
                best_team = countries[i]

**Top 4 skill set for each position**
<br>
Users need to be able to identify top skill set for each position. Having such information aids in the selection of players when creating a team or selecting what team to use. 


```python
# defining the features of players
player_features = ('Pace', 'Shooting', 'Passing', 
                   'Dribbling', 'Defending', 'Physicality')

# Top five features for every position in football
for i, val in fifa.groupby(fifa['Position'])[player_features].mean().iterrows():
    print('Position {}: {}, {}, {}, {}'.format(i, *tuple(val.nlargest(4).index)))
```

    Position CAM: Pace, Dribbling, Passing, Shooting
    Position CB: Physicality, Defending, Pace, Dribbling
    Position CDM: Physicality, Defending, Dribbling, Passing
    Position CF: Pace, Dribbling, Shooting, Passing
    Position CM: Dribbling, Pace, Physicality, Passing
    Position GK: Dribbling, Pace, Physicality, Shooting
    Position LB: Pace, Physicality, Dribbling, Defending
    Position LF: Dribbling, Pace, Shooting, Physicality
    Position LM: Pace, Dribbling, Passing, Shooting
    Position LW: Pace, Dribbling, Shooting, Passing
    Position LWB: Pace, Physicality, Dribbling, Defending
    Position RB: Pace, Physicality, Dribbling, Defending
    Position RF: Pace, Dribbling, Shooting, Passing
    Position RM: Pace, Dribbling, Passing, Shooting
    Position RW: Pace, Dribbling, Shooting, Passing
    Position RWB: Pace, Physicality, Dribbling, Defending
    Position ST: Pace, Physicality, Shooting, Dribbling


## Beyond the Original Specifications 
As soon as we formed the group, we have unanimously agreed that we will use the web-scrapping techniques to fetch our data. In the end, we were able to scrap more than 16,000 entries of current soccer player stats from the www.futbin.com website. In addition to web scrapping, we have cleaned up and augmented the data for our later applications. For example, we have to delete a few cases of entry redundancy, as certain players appeared more than once within our dataset. We were able to handle this issue by removing older versions of players and keeping the latest version of the player. We also implemented a continent map function using the pycountry package. This package allowed us to map each country to a continent using the alpha 2 code. To also defined each position into 4 major "Position Groups" for playing positions. Some of these changes are necessitated by our specific user stories, for example, we wanted to create a best continental team or selecting best team based on formation.
Some of changes are due to the fact that FIFA associations are not in 1 to 1 correlation with countries. In the end, we were albe to clean up and augment our web scrapped data for our later application. For details of our web scrapping, please refer to our python file: FIFADataWebscrapper.py  

The second important implementation was our graphical user interface. We first started this project aiming to learn information such as correlations between players' physical attributes and skill sets, or between playing positions and skill sets. We quickly realized that each one of us has different interests. The best way is for users to decide the types of information they want to learn. We learned that a Bokeh server can employed to achieve our goal. The initial implementation of Bokeh was carried out in MacBook, and we had the program successfully demoed live during our last class session. However, during additional testing, we later found out that some code cannot be run on windows. Our team was able to solve the issue and now our program can be run in both platforms, and users have total control about the types of correlations, starting 11 players, etc.    

We believe that we have used a number of unique queries and graphs for extracting and displaying our data. For example, we used fuzzy matching to manipulate the country code of the data entry, we use a pie chart to compare multiple skill sets between two players simultaneously. Additionally, our best starting 11 algorithm is able to display the best starting eleven based on formation, country, league, skill, or club. All in real time as the users updates their selction. This is the same for our scatter plot and histogram. In addition, all of our interactive graphs include a hoover tool tip that allows the users to hoover over a data point, player, or histogram bar and see more additionally display. Our aim with all of these extra tools was to provide the users with user friendly interactive tool that would respond and answer all of their questions.

**Create Slider, MultiSelect, and Input for Scatter Plot**
<br>
Users have the ability to filter data to a certain player or range of overall rating or skill level. Or select multiple clubs, leagues, countries, or positions. Using this scatter plot users can idenitfy relationships between attributes or group of players.


```python
player = AutocompleteInput(title="Player Name", completions=fifa.Name.tolist())
overall_rating = RangeSlider(title="Overall Rating", start=fifa['Overall Rating'].min(), end=fifa['Overall Rating'].max(), value=(fifa['Overall Rating'].min(), fifa['Overall Rating'].max()), step=1)
skill = RangeSlider(title="Skill", start=fifa['Skill'].min(), end=fifa['Skill'].max(), value=(fifa['Skill'].min(), fifa['Skill'].max()), step=1, default_size = 400)
club = MultiSelect(title="Clubs", options=fifa.sort_values('Club').Club.unique().tolist(), size =  10)
league = MultiSelect(title="Leagues", options=fifa.sort_values('League').League.unique().tolist(), size =  10)
country = MultiSelect(title="Countries", options=fifa.sort_values('Country').Country.unique().tolist(), size =  10)
position = MultiSelect(title="Positions", options=['CF', 'ST', 'RW', 'RF', 'LW', 'LF', 'RM', 'LM', 'CAM', 'CM', 'CDM', 'LB', 'LWB', 'RB', 'RWB', 'CB', 'GK'], size =  10)
```

**Create Scatter Plot and HTML Code for Interface**
<br>
Using columndata source to allow user to hover over datapoint to obtain additional information about each player.

## Testing
We started testing with unittest as we developed our functions. In total we have 21 unittests for our all of  our functions. With each function being tested at least once, while may being tested multiple tests. For example, for our web scrapping part, we tested that we can reach the website, that the data was scrapped in the correct format and the csv was written. We also have unittests for our support functions such as our country to continent convert and positional group function. We also insured to test all of user select functions, and functions that determined the best starting eleven. In all, all of unittest returned as success for our final program.

Additionally, we tested the portability of our program. As we have alluded to earlier, our program was first implemented heavily on a MacBook. After some struggles, we fulfilled at least one non-functional requirement -- portability. Now, our program runs on both Mac and Windows. 

## Conclusion
We were able to successfully web scrap data from the www.futbin.com website. We cleaned and augmented the data, extracted information, and finally turned these data into knowledge for all of our users. A video gamer can use our program to customize his or her soccer team based on different criteria. A FIFA World Cup soccer fan can simulate which national team will win the next World Cup. An EA developer can understand the variation of players skill stats using our scatter plot. We, as part of this team, cherished the opportunity in work in scrum environment. Together we were able to create a project that we are all proud of. 

## Improvements
Some improvements we could make to our project is including historical data of FIFA players for past versions of FIFA. This would allow us to analysis players' skills trends overtime. We could also incorporate a predictive ML model using neural network to predict future player ratings. This would be useful for users such as video gamers and developers. As this would allow them to see a prediction of players in the next years FIFA video game. Futuremore, allowing users to build a team by dragging players from a bin and provding analysis such as chemistry and team strength would be helpful knowledge. Finally, allowing a drill down from the best starting 11 to individual player would be a helpful feature.
