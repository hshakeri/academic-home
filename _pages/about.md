Research
======
My current research focuses on the structure and function of interconnected networks, often expressed via graphs that comprise a set of nodes and a set of connections between them. My goal is to transition beyond the identification of these systems and develop data-driven prescriptions, using the following approaches

- model reduction and sensor placement in high-dimensional nonlinear complex systems;
- statistical learning for underlying associations;
- analysis of stochastic processes such as spreading of  epidemics on networks;	
- hypothesis testing;
- Optimal design of interconnected structures;
- Developing scalable algorithms for operations research.

Although the applications of my research are mainly in 
high-dimensional interconnected systems,
the omnipresence of networks and the increased accessibility of mass data  makes my research portfolio heavily multidisciplinary. Therefore, I am always seeking interesting problems in different domains that can be approached from analytical and practical angles.
