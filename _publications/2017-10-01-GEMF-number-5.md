The recently proposed generalized epidemic modeling framework (GEMF) [1] lays the groundwork for systematically constructing a broad spectrum of stochastic spreading processes over complex networks. This article builds an algorithm for exact, continuous-time numerical simulation of GEMF-based processes. Moreover the implementation of this algorithm, GEMFsim, is available in popular scientific programming platforms such as MATLAB, R, Python, and C; GEMFsim facilitates simulating stochastic spreading models that fit in GEMF framework. Using these simulations one can examine the accuracy of mean-field-type approximations that are commonly used for analytical study of spreading processes on complex networks.

GEMF is suitable fo hypothesis testing, e.g.,

Fraction of nodes infected by virus type 2 (above) and virus type 1 (below) in the `SI1SI2S` competitive spreading model. Infection strength of $I_2$, $\tau_2$, was $5/\lambda_1(B)$, while the infection strength of I1, Ï„1, varied. If $2/\lambda_1(A) \le \tau_1 \le 5/\lambda_1(A)$, viruses coexist; only one virus survives outside this region.
