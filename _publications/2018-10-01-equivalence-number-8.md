To assess phenotypic bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different strata (e.g., host populations, environmental areas, manure, or sewage effluents) for epidemiological purposes, isolates of target bacteria can be obtained from a stratum using various sample types. Also, different sample processing methods can be applied. The MIC of each target antimicrobial drug for each isolate is measured. Statistical equivalence testing of the MIC data for the isolates allows evaluation of whether different sample types or sample processing methods yield equivalent estimates of the bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility in the stratum. We demonstrate this approach on the antimicrobial susceptibility estimates for (i) nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. from ground or trimmed meat versus cecal content samples of cattle in processing plants in 2013-2014 and (ii) nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. from urine, fecal, and blood human samples in 2015 (U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System data). We found that the sample types for cattle yielded nonequivalent susceptibility estimates for several antimicrobial drug classes and thus may gauge distinct subpopulations of salmonellae. The quinolone and fluoroquinolone susceptibility estimates for nontyphoidal salmonellae from human blood are nonequivalent to those from urine or feces, conjecturally due to the fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) use to treat infections caused by nontyphoidal salmonellae. We also demonstrate statistical equivalence testing for comparing sample processing methods for fecal samples (culturing one versus multiple aliquots per sample) to assess AMR in fecal Escherichia coli. These methods yield equivalent results, except for tetracyclines. Importantly, statistical equivalence testing provides the MIC difference at which the data from two sample types or sample processing methods differ statistically. Data users (e.g., microbiologists and epidemiologists) may then interpret practical relevance of the difference.

IMPORTANCE Bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) needs to be assessed in different populations or strata for the purposes of surveillance and determination of the efficacy of interventions to halt AMR dissemination. To assess phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, isolates of target bacteria can be obtained from a stratum using different sample types or employing different sample processing methods in the laboratory. The MIC of each target antimicrobial drug for each of the isolates is measured, yielding the MIC distribution across the isolates from each sample type or sample processing method. We describe statistical equivalence testing for the MIC data for evaluating whether two sample types or sample processing methods yield equivalent estimates of the bacterial phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility in the stratum. This includes estimating the MIC difference at which the data from the two approaches differ statistically. Data users (e.g., microbiologists, epidemiologists, and public health professionals) can then interpret whether that present difference is practically relevant.

Testing statistical equivalence of the estimates of phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility of nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica isolates from the ground- or trimmed-meat samples ($n=310$ for 2013 and $n=344$ for 2014) versus cecal content samples ($n=435$ for 2013 and $n=318$ for 2014) from cattle in the processing plants in the United States in 2013 (A) and 2014 (B). The data were collected by the NARMS. Aminoglycosides: GEN, gentamicin; STR, streptomycin.  $\beta$-Lactam aminopenicillins: AMC, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; AMP, ampicillin. $\beta$-Lactam cephems: AXO, ceftriaxone; FOX, cefoxitin; TIO, ceftiofur. Macrolides: AZI, azithromycin. Phenicols: CHL, chloramphenicol. Quinolones: CIP, ciprofloxacin; NAL, nalidixic acid. Sulfonamides: COT, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole; FIS, sulfisoxazole. Tetracyclines: TET, tetracycline.
