The modulus of a family of walks quantifies the richness of the family by favoring many short walks over fewer longer ones. In this paper we investigate various families of walks in order to introduce new measures for quantifying network properties using modulus. The proposed new measures are compared to other known quantities such as current-flow closeness centrality, out-degree centrality, and current-flow betweenness centrality. Our proposed method is based on walks on a network, and therefore will work in great generality. For instance, the networks we consider can be directed, multi-edged, weighted, and even contain disconnected parts. Examples are provided to show the effectiveness of our measures.

(A) Random modular network, (B) Out-degree centrality and 2-Modulus centrality measured for each node in network (A), (C) Node transition graph for SIR model, (D) Comparison of vaccination strategies based on 2-Modulus centrality and out-degree centrality for an SIR epidemic in network (A). The fraction of susceptible population () at the end of the outbreak for 2-Modulus centrality vaccinated people is larger than the fraction obtained by vaccinating using out-degree centrality.
