In a multidisciplinary effort we developed the discrete analog of modulus of curve families  in complex analysis to modulus of objects on networks with the initial purpose of characterizing functions on networks. The dual problem of modulus of families of objects on graphs provides a probabilistic view that returns a probability mass function over the objects that minimize the edge usage over the object set.
	The *p*-modulus quantifies families of paths, cycles, matchings, spanning trees and any such family of objects on the graph; this generality makes modulus an extremely versatile tool [[1]]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/2016-10-01-ModRPT-number-3.md %})  and it enables us  to gain more insights on  modeling an epidemics or a marketing strategy and prediction of the resultant collective behavior of the network.  
	Modulus has important applications in unsupervised learning where it can be used to improve popular community detection algorithms with pre-processing loop structures in the network [[2]]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/2017-10-01-LoopModulus-number-2.md %}).      
	Although modulus on graphs is a new mathematical tool and necessitates further investigations of its extensive applications  in healthcare analytics, and operations engineering are extremely promising [[3]]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/2017-10-01-diss-9.md %}),  [[4]]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/2018-10-01-GenDeg-number-11.md %}).
