The objective of this course is to introduce basic data analysis techniques including data analysis at scale. Additional topics come from the areas of software development methods, software testing and debugging and visualization. For the purpose of facilitating data manipulation and analysis, students will be introduced to essential programming techniques in Python, an increasingly prominent language for data science and “big data” manipulation.
