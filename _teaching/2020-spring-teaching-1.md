This course provides a foundation in discrete mathematics, data structures, algorithmic design and implementation, computational complexity, parallel computing, and data integrity and consistency for non-CS, non-CpE students.

Learning Outcomes
======
- Apply essential elements of computing theory, including logic, proof techniques, algorithm analysis, and discrete data models (sets, relations, and trees) 

- Formulate computation problems using data structures

- Construct appropriate relational algebra and SQL commands to query the data in a database

- Select the appropriate kind of database for the data and task at hand

- Discuss essential concepts of concurrent programming, including the use of locks

- Use advanced analysis techniques on relevant problems
