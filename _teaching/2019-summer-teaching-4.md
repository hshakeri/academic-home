The audience of this course is anyone who is using data to make insightful business decisions. We
cover principles of predictive modeling and study building statistical learning models to predict
from data. By exploratory analysis steps we gain insights into data and transition into predictive
analytics. By means of cross-validation, we select reliable models and ovoid overfitting. We
discuss how to assess the power of our models using classification performance and ROC curves.
Moreover, it is necessary to visualize the results of our analysis in clearly through compelling
plots and tables.

We are using multiple resources along the course. The following books are useful for our exposition.
If you have to choose one, the first one has higher priority.
